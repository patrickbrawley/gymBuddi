    <h2 align="left">Tell me more! </h2>
    <p>GymBuddi is an open source software that uses machine learning and computer vision to count exercise repetitions, time workouts, and provide real-time form correction tips. It runs on Raspberry Pi and uses a camera to track movements. By utilising machine learning technologies such as OpenCV and TensorFlow, GymBuddi will ensure when a user is in the correct positions whilst performing the exercise.</p>
