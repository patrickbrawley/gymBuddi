gymBuddi is created for use on a Raspberry Pi to allow users to take the gymBuddi with them wherever they choose to work out. Let gymBuddi be your new personal work out partner!

What is gymBuddi?
gymBuddi is free open source software that helps gym goes achieve perfect form in excersie workouts, while counting the number of exercise reps correctly performed. 

The AI software utalises Posenet and openCV to detect your body positions. gymBuddi ensures your body is in the correct position to perform the workout. This helps users to complete the exercises, while keeping track of the number of repetitions, and lowers the chances of injury due to poor form. In future we hope to add a large variety of exercises to allow the users to utalise gymBuddi in a varied workout.

Currently the Code is still being developed however we hope to add a DEMO Video here when the code is up and running.
