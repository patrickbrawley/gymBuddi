    <p>GymBuddi is an open source software that uses machine learning and computer vision to count exercise repetitions and provide real-time form correction tips. It runs on Raspberry Pi and uses a camera to track movements. By utilizing machine learning technologies such as OpenCV and PoseNet, GymBuddi tracks key points on the user's body to ensure they are in the correct position whilst performing the exercise.</p>
