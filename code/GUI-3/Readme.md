This folder shows the the code to build the current GUI interface. Currently this is not compatable to use with the gymBuddi's Video Processing c++ code, however this is the code that runs the initial pre-release! Please refere to the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/patrickbrawley/gymBuddi/wiki/Installation-Guide) to view our great, user frindly GUI!

The GUI allows users to select for a variety of different pre-set exercises and from there it will start a timer when the user is in the correct position. The GUI comes with button to start, stop and reset the timer! 

What are you waiting for? Go try it out!
