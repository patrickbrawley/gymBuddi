# gymBuddi Video Processing - C++ Source Code

## Description

This folder contains all the C++ code for the gymBuddi video processing. Our team is working hard to create a CNN model that will be used with this code for predicting the users positions. If you're interested in learning more about how this code works, please refer to our [WIKI page- How It Works Section](https://github.com/patrickbrawley/gymBuddi/wiki/How-It-Works).

## Compatibility with gymBuddi GUI

Please note that the gymBuddi-created GUI is currently not compatible with this code. If you want to check out our GUI, please refer to the code [HERE](https://github.com/patrickbrawley/gymBuddi/tree/main/code/GUI/GUI-3). An installation guide for viewing the GUI on your personal Raspberry Pi is available on the WIKI.
